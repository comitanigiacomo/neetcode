Here's the full description of the [problem](https://neetcode.io/problems/duplicate-integer)

To solve this problem, one might initially consider a brute-force approach, which involves checking for each element in the array nums if there is at least one other element in nums with the same value. If such an element is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Although this solution has a space complexity of O(1), it has a time complexity of O(n^2).

```python
    class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(nums)): 
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)): 
                if  nums[i] == nums[j] : return True
        return False
```

A second solution might involve sorting the input array nums to align any duplicate values next to each other. Then, by iterating through the sorted array, we can check if there are any consecutive identical values.

This approach maintains a space complexity of O(1) but improves the time complexity to O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

```python 
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if sorted_nums[i] == sorted_nums[i+1]: return True
        return False
```

Finally, we can sacrifice some space complexity to further improve the time complexity. By using a hashmap, we can iterate through the elements of nums, adding each element to the hashmap only if it is not already present. If an element is found in the hashmap, we return True. If we reach the end of the loop without finding duplicates, we return False. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the storage used by the hashmap.

```python
class Solution:
    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashmap = set() # in python i set sono implementati tramite hashmap

        for n in nums: 
            if n in hashmap: return True
            hashmap.add(n)
        return False
```
