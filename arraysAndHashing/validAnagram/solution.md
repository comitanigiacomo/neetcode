Here's the full description of the [problem](https://neetcode.io/problems/is-anagram)

A straightforward solution involves counting the occurrence of each character in both strings and comparing the counts. If the counts for all characters match, the strings are anagrams.

To implement this, we can use two hash maps (dictionaries in Python), one for each string, and iterate over the keys of the first hash map to check if the corresponding values match the values in the second hash map.

It is essential to check if the lengths of the two strings are equal at the beginning. If they are not, the strings cannot be anagrams.

Here's the initial implementation:

```python 
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t): return False

        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0) # se la chiave non esiste ancora nella mappa, la funzione ritorna 0, e in questo caso viene quindi assegnato 1 come valore
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)
        for c in countS: 
            if countS[c] != countT.get(c, 0): return False # Anche qui nel caso in cui in t non ci sia una lettera presente in a, per evitare keyerror la funzione mette 0 come valore
        
        return True
```
The space complexity of this solution is O(s+t) due to the size of the hash maps, and the time complexity is O(s+t). This solution is efficient but requires additional memory for the hash maps.


In Python, the `Counter` class from the collections module can simplify this approach. `Counter` is essentially a hash map that counts the occurrences of elements.

The simplified implementation using `Counter` is as follows:

```python 
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

To achieve an O(1) space complexity, we can sort the two strings. If the sorted versions of the strings are identical, then the original strings are anagrams.

A good sorting algorithm operates with constant space complexity and a time complexity of O(nlogn). This is the best approach when minimizing space usage.

Here's the implementation using sorting:

```python 
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

The first approach uses additional memory but is straightforward. The second approach simplifies the code using Python's Counter class. The final approach minimizes space complexity by leveraging sorting.
